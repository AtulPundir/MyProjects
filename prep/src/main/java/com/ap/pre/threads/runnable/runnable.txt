Key Points:

Runnable Interface:
Contains a single abstract method: void run().
Does not return a result or throw checked exceptions.

Thread Class:
The start() method creates a new thread and invokes the run() method.

Decoupling Logic and Thread:
Using Runnable separates the task's logic from the thread management.


Advantages of Runnable:
Allows your class to extend another class, as it doesn't require extending Thread.
Useful for defining tasks that can be executed by multiple threads.
This approach is simple, reusable, and aligns with Javaâ€™s object-oriented design principles.
